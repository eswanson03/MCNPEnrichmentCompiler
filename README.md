This was a part of a project done at NIST for the 2024 Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF). The goal of this project was to do a core optimization of the 
NIST Neutron Source (NNS) preconceptual reactor. This was done by reading through a .o MCNP input file and quantifying the enrichment in each material used for the reactor's fuel assemblies. 
This .o input file is for the equilibrium core state (ECS), the ideal/optimal core conditions for the first state of the first cycle of the reactor's lifetime. Quantification of the fissile/non-fissile mass and 
enrichment of each fuel assembly allows core configuration.
